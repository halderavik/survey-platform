# PLANNING.md - Survey Platform Project

## Vision
Create an intuitive, powerful survey platform that enables users to build standard and advanced surveys (including MaxDiff and conjoint analysis), collect responses, and visualize results through an engaging dashboard.

## Architecture

### System Components
1. **Frontend Application**
   - Survey Builder Interface
   - Survey Preview & Testing
   - Results Dashboard
   - User Authentication & Management

2. **Backend Services**
   - User Authentication API
   - Survey Management API
   - Response Collection API
   - Analytics Engine

3. **Database Layer**
   - Survey Definitions Store
   - Response Data Store
   - User Management Store

4. **Deployment Infrastructure**
   - Web Hosting
   - Database Hosting
   - File Storage

### System Flow
1. User registers/logs in
2. User creates survey using builder interface
3. System generates test survey link
4. User reviews test results and makes adjustments
5. User launches final survey
6. System collects responses
7. System processes and displays results in dashboard
8. User can download raw data

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js or Chart.js
- **Form Management**: Formik or React Hook Form

### Backend
- **API Layer**: Node.js with Express or NestJS
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **File Handling**: Multer for file uploads (design files)

### Database
- **Primary Database**: MongoDB (as specified)
- **Caching Layer**: Redis (optional, for performance)

### Deployment
- **Hosting**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or GitLab CI
- **Containerization**: Docker with Kubernetes/Docker Compose

## Key Features

### Survey Building
- Drag-and-drop interface for building surveys
- Template library for common survey types
- Question bank for reusing questions
- Logic branching and skip patterns
- Randomization options (question order, answer options)
- Preview and test functionality

### Question Types
- **Basic Module**:
  - Single select (radio buttons)
  - Multi-select (checkboxes)
  - Open-ended text (short/long)
  - Rating scales
  - Likert scale questions
  - Matrix/grid questions
  - Ranking questions
  - Demographic questions

- **Advanced Module**:
  - MaxDiff (Maximum Difference Scaling)
  - Choice-based conjoint
  - Design file uploading and processing

### Survey Distribution
- Unique survey links
- Email distribution integration
- Social media sharing
- QR code generation
- Embedded surveys for websites

### Respondent Experience
- Mobile-responsive design
- Progress indicator
- Save and continue later functionality
- Custom branding options
- Multiple language support

### Results Dashboard
- Real-time response tracking
- Response completion rates
- Average completion time
- Dropout points analysis
- Response quality metrics
- Basic statistical analysis
- Data visualization tools
- Export functionality (CSV, Excel, SPSS)

## Technical Constraints
- MongoDB as the database solution
- Must support file uploads for MaxDiff and conjoint designs
- Must be scalable to handle varying loads of survey responses
- Must ensure data privacy and compliance with regulations

## Development Approach
- Agile methodology with 2-week sprints
- User-centered design process
- Continuous integration and deployment
- Automated testing (unit, integration, and E2E)

## Timeline
- **Phase 1 (2 months)**: Core functionality - user accounts, basic survey module, test links
- **Phase 2 (2 months)**: Advanced modules - MaxDiff, conjoint analysis, dashboard v1
- **Phase 3 (1 month)**: Enhanced analytics, UI refinements, performance optimization
- **Phase 4 (1 month)**: Beta testing, bug fixes, documentation

## Success Metrics
- Survey creation time (target: under 30 minutes for standard surveys)
- Survey completion rate (target: >85%)
- System uptime (target: 99.9%)
- User satisfaction (target: >4.5/5 rating)
